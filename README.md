# Alexs Web Portfolio

**Developer:** Shailynn Devereux

**Module:** Web Development [WEDE5020]

## Purpose
- My task required me to build the first version of Alexâ€™s personal portfolio site, which would be a single, well-structured HTML page that introduces Alex and showcases their talent.

**What I Learned:**
- A new skill i learnt from doing this website was to add an icon next to the website links and tags.

**If I Had More Time:**
- If i had more time i would have personalised this according to the person, meaning i would have added neon borders with a more creative and bold background according to the user and their traits.
